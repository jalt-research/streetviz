The script is run on a job file such as DRS.txt.
It produces a map according to the parameters given there.
The map uses data queried from OpenStreetMap using the specified center and radius (the query area is a square containing the circle of the given radius).
Many other decorative options are allowed, and the output is written to a specified file.
If an output file for the street bearings is given, these will also be computed and visualized with the `osmnx` defaults.
